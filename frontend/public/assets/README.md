# Assets Directory

## Background Image
Place your background image here:
- **File**: `background.jpg` (or `.png`, `.webp`)
- **Recommended size**: 1920x1080 or larger
- **Location**: `frontend/public/assets/background.jpg`

The image will be used as the main background with a gradient overlay (lighter at top, darker at bottom).

## Playlist Images
Place playlist cover images here:
- **Directory**: `frontend/public/assets/playlists/`
- **Naming**: `playlist-0.jpg`, `playlist-1.jpg`, `playlist-2.jpg`, etc.
- **Recommended size**: 300x300px or larger (square images work best)
- **Format**: JPG, PNG, or WebP

The app will automatically assign images to playlists based on their index. Make sure you have at least as many images as you have playlists (currently 8 playlists, so you need at least 8 images).

### Alternative Naming
You can also name images based on playlist names (lowercase, with hyphens):
- Example: `summer-vibes-2024.jpg` for playlist "Summer Vibes 2024"
